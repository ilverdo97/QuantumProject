# Quantum Desk Calculator with Qiskit

## Problem definition
The task is to build quantum circuits that perform arithmetic operations between the binary reprentations of two positive integers.
The circuit must be implemented in Qiskit and demonstrated on a one or two instances.

## Implementation details
### Prerequisites
- Python3.7+
- qiskit

### Operations implemented:
- [x] Addition using QFT
- [x] Subtraction using QFT
- [x] Multiplication using Addition QFT
- [x] Division using Subtraction QFT
- [x] Exponential using Multiplication

### Clone the repository
