# QuantumProject
# Quantum Desk Calculator with Qiskit

## Problem definition 
The task is to build a quantum circuit that performs the difference between the binary representation of two positive integers. 
The circuit can be defined as a variation of the quantum adder explained in class and using the Quantum Fourier Transform. 
The circuit must be implemented in `qiskit` and demonstrated on a one or two instances. 
The project can be extended with the implementation of a complete desk calculator.
